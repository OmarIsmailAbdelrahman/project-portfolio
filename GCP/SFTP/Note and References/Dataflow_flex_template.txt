Flex Template 
	flex template is used for triggering dataflow, it's the recommended method, the pipeline is packaged as docker image in artifact registry with a template specification file in cloud storage which container a pointer to the docker image "CICD".
	
	Classic templates
		older version of dataflow templates that contains the pipeline graph in json serialization form, 
		flex comparsion:
			- it requires value provider interface which is not always supported for data sources and sinks, which is not required in flex.
			- it's a static graph, and flex is dynamic as you can change the parameters.
			- Flex can preform preprocessing during pipeline construction
			
	benefits:
	1. seperate design and deployment, as it can be deployed any time
	2. have parameters to set when deployed
	3. no need for development environment or any pipeline dependencies to install
	4. It's a code artifact that stored in source control repository, and used in CICD pipelines

Structure of Flex Template:
	it contains:
		- src package "source code for pipeline"
		- launcher file "to submit the pipeline to runner"
