# Overview
This repository contains my projects and POCs. It also includes my notes, thoughts, strategies, and the solutions I've developed along the way. Youâ€™ll find reflections on various products, as well as my personal roadmap for different fields such as Data Engineering, MLOps, Cloud Engineering, and other paths.

Please note that some of the projects may contain mistakes or might not be fully optimized, as many of them were created for experimentation and learning purposes.

# Personal Note
The main purpose of this repository is to help anyone who is in a similar situationâ€”someone who has or had the same ideas but doesn't know where to start. Instead of starting from scratch, this might give you a head start or inspire new ideas to build upon.

You'll find a mix of project types here:

- Some are simple projects used to test new tools and explore how they work.

- Others are closer to production-level productsâ€”though they might still seem simple, as Iâ€™m still learning ðŸ˜„.

I highly recommend reading the documentation for each project to get the most out of them.

This repository is intended to include most of my work starting from 2025. If you notice any mistakes, misinformation, or missing content, please feel free to contact me via email at Omar.IMohammed@hotmail.comâ€”I would greatly appreciate it.

If you need any help or guidance with the content in this repository, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.

It might look rough at the moment, but Iâ€™ll do my best to improve it, and it should evolve over timeâ€”so please stay tuned!
